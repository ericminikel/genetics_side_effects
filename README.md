This repository holds the data and source code for a manuscript in progress.

Here, you can:

+ Run the source code to reproduce the figures from the input datasets. Just say `Rscript `[`src/drug_safety_analysis.R`](/src/drug_safety_analysis.R), noting the dependencies at the top of the script. It completes in about 16 minutes on a 2021 MacBook Pro. The script reproduces Figures 1-4 and S1-S2, Tables 1 and S1-S21, and stats_for_text.txt, all of which you can find in [display_items](/display_items).
+ If you're curious, you can also browse the source code for other scripts that prepared this releasable analytical dataset, in [src](/src). These scripts require some inputs that are either too large for GitHub, and/or not approved for public release, thus, you will not be able to successfully run them after cloning the repository; they are provided simply for reference in case you want to see what we did.
+ Browse the input datasets in [data](/data).
